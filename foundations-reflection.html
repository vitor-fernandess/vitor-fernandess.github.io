    <p>The core activities during the foundations was fundamental for my learning and personal growth to become a better person and a better programmer. 
        Learning concepts like EQ and self-awareness  was extremely helpful to make myself aware that my values can affect people around me  positively, and or negatively.</p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext"> three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    The core learning during foundations opened my mind about myself in a few ways.
     It made me realize that asking for help is normal and it does not make people think that I am not smart.
      It also made me notice that the energy that I have can affect other people around me.

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    Values, empathy and self-awareness can help me and the people around me to have a smoother workflow,
     because I am aware of my emotional state and how it might affect people that I am working with.
  
  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">What has surprised you the most about core learning?</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    I was not expecting to study EQ while studying coding. It definitely changed my whole perspective on how to work. 
  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    Self-Awareness. I believe most people tend to avoid or mask their feelings, 
    which can be bad for themselves and the people around them.
  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext"> are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    I believe that one of  the values that Dev Academy has is to make better people and better programmers at the same time. 

  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
	Not at all. It definitely made me realize a couple things that I had to learn about myself, 
    and also how to work better with others. Challenges like “listeting and looping”, 
    “pair programming”, and “Introduce yourself” are extremely important to shape a better programmer and a better person.
