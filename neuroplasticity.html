   <p>A brief discussion about how Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset can affect my learning journey.</p>

  <p class="explanation-b">
    Neuroplasticity is the ability that the brain has to change and adapt due to experience.
     There are two types of Neuroplasticity called Functional plasticity which allows the brain to move damaged functions to areas that are not damaged for example a treatment for patients who have broca’s aphasia.
     Which is caused by damage to the brain. There is also Structural plasticity which allows the brain to to change its physical structure as a result of learning. 
     Learning a new language would be a good example of Structural plasticity where you engage in a brand new concept in creating a new habit to remember and “learn” the language.
     Both are fundamental for the brain to reorganize pathways, create new connections and even create new neurons.  <br>
     I use a few principles of Neuroplasticity to help with my studies to benefit me and get the most of the knowledge that I am able to learn. 
     My learning plan is to repeatedly go over the same material that I was reading earlier to reinforce my learning using short breaks. And also to code every day for 20 minutes or more.

  <p class="explanation-b">
     Growth mindset is the way you view and react to challenges and setbacks. 
     I believe that the way that we view challenges is very important, since I was little I have always enjoyed a little challenge. 
     Challenges are really important for our growth and I have always approached them as a lesson to be learned in life.
