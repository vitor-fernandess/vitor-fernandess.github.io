            <p>
              It is the end of the foundations now and I managed to gain a lot of experience and all of my expectations from the facilitators team were met so far. <br>
              Now that I am starting bootcamp I believe I should add or edit some details to this learning plan. I would like to start talking about my long term goal.<br>
              My long term goal is to have enough experience to start my own game studio. 
              I chose Dev Academy to gain enough experience to launch my first tech job, and also to develop good personal growth while I am not able to achieve my long term goal.<br>
              My biggest strength would definitely be that I love to work with a team, and I can easily work with people due to my values. 
              My biggest limitation stay the same from sprint 2, 
              my financial status at the moment is not the best and sometimes is really hard to just concentrate on the work that I have to get done when I also have to worry about paying my rent and making budget plans to check if I have enough money left to do the groceries.<br>
              There are definitely a few other challenges that might take place. 
              For example Speaking in front of people might be a little intimidating for me since English is not my  first language and I don't really do well with speeches or presentations.<br>
              I believe that challenges give me plenty of room for me to learn from them and also improve myself, and I hope to work on them to improve my presentation, leadership skills and also receiving feedback.<br>
              My expectations from the bootcamp team are still the same that I had from the foundation team, which is to show good support to the students when they need help. 
              So far the expectations that I had from the foundation team have been met.<br>
              I expect to achieve my plans of being job ready to launch my first tech job and also to have the best support from the supporting team. 
              I believe that the best way that I can find that support is to seek help whenever I get stuck for more than 20 minutes. 
              I have been following this plan since the beginning of foundations and I hope it works the same way while studying in bootcamp.<br>
              It has definitely been an amazing time during foundations where I am sure that I learned a lot of essential skills to proceed to the bootcamp.<br>

          <p class="explanation-b">
            My Long time goal is to have my own business related to the gaming  and tech industry.

          <p class="explanation-b">
            I believe my biggest strength is that I know when I have to ask for help. My biggest limitation is that I have a problem trying to focus 
            on something when there is a lot of distractions around me.

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Human skill to develop</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I would love to develop strategic analysis and analytical thinking as my new skills while at Dev Academy.

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Workload management</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I believe that the best way to manage myself to work and study productively is timing and reminding myself of the work that I need to get done. 
            I usually write on a little board right next to my bedroom door the task and the time that I have to achieve my tasks.
            I also believe that communicating with my colleagues and facilitators will help me to not feel overwhelmed.  
          </p>

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Seeking for help timely</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I usually seek help if I am stuck in the same problem for more than 10 mins. 
            Whenever I realize that I am stuck I take a 2 minute break away from the problem  and if that is not helping I try to figure it out myself by searching on the web.
          </p>

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Expectation from facilitatos</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I expect the facilitators to be very communicative towards students and attentive to the questions on discord.
