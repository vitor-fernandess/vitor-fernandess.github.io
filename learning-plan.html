          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">strengths and limitations</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I believe my biggest strength is that I know when I have to ask for help. My biggest limitation is that I have a problem trying to focus 
            on something when there is a lot of distractions around me.

            I would love to develop strategic analysis and analytical thinking as my new skills while at Dev Academy.

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Workload management</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I believe that the best way to manage myself to work and study productively is timing and reminding myself of the work that I need to get done. 
            I usually write on a little board right next to my bedroom door the task and the time that I have to achieve my tasks.
            I also believe that communicating with my colleagues and facilitators will help me to not feel overwhelmed.  
          </p>

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Seeking for help timely</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I usually seek help if I am stuck in the same problem for more than 10 mins. 
            Whenever I realize that I am stuck I take a 2 minute break away from the problem  and if that is not helping I try to figure it out myself by searching on the web.
          </p>

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Expectation from facilitatos</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            I expect the facilitators to be very communicative towards students and attentive to the questions on discord.
