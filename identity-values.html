            <p>Identities and valeus are important because it influences how we interpret and react to situations.
              It is really important for us to be aware of our own identity and the values that we hold in relation to the world around us.

          <p class="explanation-b">
            There was one time back in Brazil I was walking to the bakery with my cousin, when we saw a guy accidentally dropping his wallet on the street because he was running to catch the bus. 
            We tried to run to give the wallet back to the man, but the bus had left. Since we could not find the man we went to a police station to ask the cops if they could locate the man and give back to him his belongings.
           Fortunately they were able to contact the man and return his wallet.<br>
           I still believe that I made the correct decision until this day. 
           Mostly because of what my family taught me. I am 100% sure that the values that I hold are and will always be because of my family.

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">the influence of culture in My identity and values</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            My culture and the people that I grew up with play a massive role in the influence that I have on my values and Identity.  
            Most of the people that are from the same area that I was raised in have similar values. 
            eg Family, Loyalty and respect above anything.

          <p class="explanation-b">
            According to “Via Character Strengths” my top 5 strengths are love, humor, hope, bravery, and teamwork.
            I believe that having TeamWork as one of my top strengths I would never be “alone” and it is a great perk to have when studying/working with a group.

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">How my limitations will affect my learning journey</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            The main limitation would be my current financial status. 
            This limitation would affect my learning journey by making me overthink if I have enough money to pay rent, buy groceries. etc. <br>
            It would also affect the equipment that I have to study. eg a nice computer setup, more than one monitor, a nice gaming chair. etc.

          <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</p></div> <br>
          <p class="explanation-b">
            There was one time that the football team I used to play back in Brazil was playing against our regional rival. In the middle of the game our captain was sent off so it was up to me to decide what play to run.
            I thought only my plays were relevant because I had a better football curriculum than any other player in the team. 
            <br> One of the other players in the team had a better play that he shared with the team, deep down I knew his play would make more sense to run. However, I persisted in running my play. We ended up losing the game and I realized that my ego made me a bad team player. 
            <br>From that day forward I changed a lot and also learned that it is crucial to listen to everyone’s opinion before deciding something that would affect other people too. 
           If I could go back in time I would definitely listen to everyone’s plays and we would all vote and come to an agreement in what play we should run that game.
