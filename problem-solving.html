  <div class="main">
   <p>When studying or working with programming you will get stuck and find a few problems very often.
     It is pretty common in reality, and the best thing you can do to be prepared is to have sort of a “solving problems plan” to either minimize the problem or to find a way to solve the problem.
     In my case for example I get stuck all the time but I always manage to solve the problem.<br>
     I was working on a project and I got stuck in a block of code that was giving me an error but I had no clue why it was giving me an error. 
     I was feeling frustrated and sad but after 15 mins stuck in that block of code, I decided to go make myself a coffee and then try again, when I came back I realized that I was not reading the error message properly, 
     I was only reading “Error” and trying to figure it out the rest by staring at my code, but when I read the full error message I managed to solve it. 
     Since then I learned that reading the error message is really important and it can give a little hint of what area is not working or what we did wrong in the code.

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">rubber ducky method</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
     The Rubber ducky Method is one of the best techniques to use before starting jumping straight into the problem to solve it. 
     I feel very comfortable using the Rubber Ducky method to break the problem into small chunks like a to-do list.

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">Pseudocode</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
     Pseudo code is basically writing a detailed and readable description of what the program or algorithm should do.  
     I Feel very confident since it uses “simple”natural syntax and formatting that can be easily understood.  
  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">reading error messages</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    I believe that Reading error messages is pretty self explanatory. 
    And I do feel very confident when reading it and understanding what the message says.  
  </p>
  
  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">console.logging</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    Console.logging refers to “console.log()” frequently to check if the code is running, the values of a code, and if it matches what you expected it to be. 
    I feel a little confident, and it's definitely something that I should be doing more.  
  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">googling</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    I would say googling is the most important problem solving technique to master.  
    I feel super confident googling for help and also searching up stuff that I am not familiar with.  
  </p>

  <div class="subtitle"> <p class="subtext">asking for help</p></div> <br>
  <p class="explanation-b">
    I learned that I do not have to feel shy when asking for help. 
    It was really hard for me to ask for help because I would feel a little stupid for not knowing a “basic” of something that we had studied before. 
    I had to watch a few youtube videos and visit a few web pages to understand which was time consuming and make me fall back a bit.  
    However,  I understand better now that people in my cohort are more than welcome to help me with anything that I need related to the course, especially the facilitators. 
    It took me a while to understand that, but now I feel really confident to ask for help.  
  </p>
